          <pre><font color="red">NOTICE:</font></pre>
          To those expecting picture of Hope, which would, under normal
          circumstances, considering I went to Idaho pretty much solely to visit
          her, be reasonable to expect, you will be sorely disappointed. She has
          'caused me to promise not to post pictures of her unless she approves
          of them, and, at the moment, she is not able to go over the pictures.
          *blinks* soory.<br /><br /><br />

          <pre><font color="red">NOTICE:</font></pre>
          Partially rescinding the previous notice, Hope was able to go over the
          pictures, and ventured to find two pictures of herself acceptable for
          display to the general public. The rest must remain hidden until she
          come more to her senses. Until then, enjoy.<br /><br /><br />

          I know I'm bad at taking picture.<br /><br /><br />

        <img src="74.jpg" /><br />Yes, this picture is upside down. That because
        Leyna and Hope thought that, if you took a picture upside down, then
        turned it right side up, it would be... mirrored? Somthing like that.
