<b>Please submit a one-page essay that explains why you have chosen your major, department or program. This essay should include the reasons why you've chosen the major, any goals or relevant work plans and any other information you would like us to know.</b><p>

	I�ve wanted to be a computer programmer for� a long time.  I took a few classes over the summer between my seventh and eighth grade years (I think) in QBASIC programming, and, ever since, have been hooked on the idea of doing something like that for a living.  I�ve taken, since then, almost every programming class my school offers (I have to take Java as an independent study this year because of scheduling conflicts) and continue to love it.  The way that programming requires your brain to work is one that comes very naturally to me, how I usually think, even when not programming.  The problem solving and logic structures that programming requires of you, those things that don�t always come completely naturally, that are the issues that you have to wrap your mind around a little before you can continue with your program, those are things I especially love tackling.  I love moving my mind in those directions that it doesn�t typically go.<br>
	So far as future plans go, I would like to find some work, eventually, in the field of coding computer games.  I want to have a job that I would want to go to every day, and I love coding.  I know that being in a field like games would put me on the cutting edge, not just following those ideas that people before me had done, but always trying to get the most out of the resources present, always having to innovate and think.  Additionally, I think that working with something like games would be exciting, in that those things that you got done would mean something.  When you finished coding a feature, it wouldn�t just be some part of a tax program or part of a tool in a graphics program, but it would be a palpable part of the game experience, another step towards conceiving this new creation.  Games are almost always a new creation, never a copy of a previous application.  This is my dream, to be a part of creating the core of that experience that will be enjoyed by many, the world over.<P>
