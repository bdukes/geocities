<b>Relate a personal experience that reveals something about you to your future college roommate.</b><p>

The summer of 2001 I went with my church to Rhea County Tennessee in order to help some people out.  We had been in contact with a group out there which organised volunteers to help needy people.  Our group split up, and my half spent a week covering the bottom of a family's trailer to aid with their heating bills.  We all had a wonderful time, working with our hands to spend our time physically helping people in a concrete way.  Spending a week focused on one family helped us to understand that we were not only doing good, but actually helping individual people.  Often times, in other community service endeavours the church took, the work just seemed like tedium that had to be gone through before we could get back to the church to whatever food typically awaited us.  Here, we came to understand moreso the results of our actions, to understand exactly how we were being used to bless other people.  It was a wonderful week for us all.<p>
