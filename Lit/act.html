<b>In the space provided below, please describe which of these activities (extracurricular and personal activities or work experience) has had the most meaning for you, and why.</b><p>

I very much enjoy being a worship leader for my church's youth service every week. That not only involves leading the youth through the songs during the service, but I also am involved with a weekly planning session, with setting up the room prior to the service, with practicing with the band, and, at times, with speaking or teaching in various capacities during the service. The position is meaningful to me in that I have such a dramatic influence over all the other kids. I am a leader, and, as such, I have to keep myself in the mindset that I want to model for the other kids. I have to keep myself focused on those things I feel it is important for the kids to focus on, and doing those things I feel it is important for the kids to do. Having this position is meaningful to me as it gives me a chance to be a part of this institution that is helping kids, while, at the same time, being a tremendous aid to myself. Through helping the kids learn how to do the things important to worship, I learn, myself, how to do those same things better.<p>
