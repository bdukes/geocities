<b>We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about an activity you pursued for the pleasure of it.</b><p>

Ever since getting into a QBASIC class during middle school, I have loved doing programming whenever I can. A couple of friends and I have taken one of the programs we made in that initial class and worked on it whenever we got together, and are still working on it. Using my free time to work with that code and figure out how to better make things work or how to best implement some new option is great fun for me. Working my head around those problems that pop up when coding is something I love to do.<p>
