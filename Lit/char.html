<b>What personal characteristics do you most value in yourself? What characteristics do others most value in you?</b><p>

What I most value in myself is primarily based on what other people most value in me, which has been called my "heart," being, how much I care for other people. Most of my free time I choose to devote to making myself available to my friends. I've seen through past experiences that a lot of people, especially those closest to me, have been helped greatly through me, when they couldn't be helped by others, so, keeping that in mind, I find reason to make sure I am available to help when help is needed.<p>
