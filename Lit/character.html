<b>Describe any characteristics of yourself or your family that have been important to your personal developement.</b><p>

	One of my characteristics which has served me well through my years has been my self-discipline.  I am able to set goals, and, so long as I deem my goals to be worthwhile, have little trouble attaining them, regardless of whatever hardship I may have to experience to do so.  Getting invited to my school�s various Christian clubs (first Club 121, and then the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) involved me losing sleep once a week when I wasn�t even getting enough sleep to begin with.  Regardless, I had no problem with getting up on time, every week, in spite of how I physically felt, because I had decided that those endeavors were worthwhile.  As well, during the year of 2001, I believe, I received a One-Year Bible, and, so decided to read through that in the year.  I made time everyday to set aside for that, and am still in the habit of reading and praying every day, since I feel those things are very important to do.<BR>
	A characteristic of my family that has been very beneficial in my personal development has been our point of view on the world, especially so far as the concept of beauty is concerned.  I�m not exactly sure how we came to be this way, as often times I can see the various members of my family acting contrary to it, but in general, how I was raised led me to have a world view in which I think of myself and others primarily in a sense of their intellectual, emotional and mental worth before I consider their looks.  When I pass what society would say are beautiful women on the street, or see them in a television show or movie, I care less about what they look like and what they�re wearing or revealing than about what they have to say and what they do.  Even if it�s just a case of passing someone on the street, in which the only thing I know about them is their looks, I am able to view them only as a person and not as a sexual object, to the point that it is surprising to me when anyone makes a comment on their physical person being anything more than just a vehicle for their living and getting around.  Whatever it is about my upbringing that has instilled this in me, I am very thankful for it.  As our world becomes more and more geared towards using sex to attract people to whatever corporations want to sell, and as I see so many of my fellow people falling victim to the mindsets that are a part of that, I am able to stand as a voice of reason to many of my loved ones who struggle and help them to see themselves and others as they were meant to be seen, as children of God instead of just pieces of flesh that need to exploit themselves to find any semblance of love or meaning.<p>
