 In dreams of my future, I walk in lush, tropical forests, living with the native peoples and teaching them about a love unlike one they�ve ever conceived.  I work with a team writing computer programs to aid in translating the Bible into the languages of those who lack it.  I live in a house in the inner city with a free flow of people needing and receiving help.  I dream of bringing aid and love to those who need it most.<br>
 When people ask me what I want to do when I get out of college, what I want to be when I grow up, why I�m studying computer science, my answer is that I want to be a missionary.  I want to work with Wycliffe Bible Translators or some similar organization that would allow me to be sent to live with a community of indigenous peoples that do not yet have the Bible translated into their language.  From there, I would learn their language and, if necessary, teach them to read and write it.  I would also build fellowship with them, teach them about God, and then return to America to start copying the Bible into their language.  What I don�t want to be is a missionary who simply goes to another country to give people food or medical care.  My goal is to spread the good news of Jesus Christ and nothing short of that will be acceptable.<br>
 When I�m not in the missionary field, I plan to work as a software developer at Wycliffe in order to write software that expedites the translation process.  One of my passions, outside of computer programming and spreading the Gospel, is linguistics.  I am especially interested in linguistics as it pertains to computers and translation software.  I hope to be able to contribute significantly to reducing the time necessary to produce Bibles in languages that do not yet have them.<br>
 Another of my dreams is to have an inner-city ministry.  In the past few years, I have had an increasing passion to help those that the world has left behind, those that are ignored and downtrodden.  I would love it if wherever I lived became a place where people in need could get helped and be loved.  I have visions of meeting homeless people in the city, developing a relationship, giving them a warm bed, a shower, food, and helping them to get a job, all the while showing them God�s love.<br>
 I feel that Webster would be an excellent place to get a foothold on seeing my dreams become reality.  From getting a degree in computer science, to living in a multicultural environment, opportunities to develop the skills I need to make my dreams real abound at Webster.  With Webster�s excellent study abroad program, I can be exposed to other cultures, other languages, and to modes of thought not prominent in America.  Living close to a big city, I can minister to the people living there.  Webster is a great university to help me to develop into someone who can see his dreams come true to help me become what I�m meant to be.<p>
