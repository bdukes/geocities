<b>Discuss some creative work that illustrates the way you see the world and the wayyou see yourself in the world.  The creative work may be a scientific theory, novel, film, poem, song, or other art form.</b><p>

	The fictional creative works of C.S. Lewis, including his Chronicles of Narnia and his space trilogy (<u>Out of the Silent Planet</u>, <u>Perelandra</u>, and <u>That Hideous Strength</u>), show worlds which, although very outlandish and, in some aspects, completely unrealistic, adhere to the higher codes of life and what it is and how it takes place.  The Chronicles of Narnia, in one sense a set of children�s stories, in another an allegory of the relationship between humans and God, introduces us to a God who cries for our sickly mothers, who is powerful, fierce and wild, while still being good and gentle.  Aslan, the lion, the son of the emperor beyond the mountains, sings beautiful songs, which cause all of creation to come to be and to grow.  He allows Himself to be sacrificed so that the life of a boy who deserved to die would be spared, even when He knew that the boy would never accept it or be grateful.  He brings into His beautiful paradise all of those who devoted their lives to Him, even if they called Him by the name of another god.  He brings help where it is needed, and gives comfort in His gigantic, soft paws to all who mourn.  He provides a life-giving river and compels the people of His world to drink and live.  And, in all of this, He uses children to work His will, to defeat His enemies, and to reveal His being.<br>
	The space trilogy shows a very different world, but with many of the same underlying results.  Professor Ransom travels to various planets throughout the course of the three books, and discovers lands under the rule of benevolent, mostly-invisible angel-like beings.  As he travels throughout the places untainted by the rebellious ruler of Earth, he discovers the way things were supposed to be.  The travelers fear being attacked by these strange creatures they come into contact with, but find that the creatures have no reason to attack them, don�t even understand how to fear them.  Ransom becomes the defender of these unspoiled paradises, as evil men attempt to exploit the worlds.  He, being the only human on God�s side who knows how to communicate with these people, having learned the �old language� on Mars, is sent to protect the Venusian Eve.  Random serves as the servant of God in this battle, not because of any special goodness within himself, but just because of talents bestowed on him through the course of his life.  He serves God only through relying on God to give him strength and ideas, not because of his own achievements.<BR>
	Our world is ruled by a fierce and gentle lion of a God, who uses everyday men and even children to fulfill His plan for the world, for the salvation of the human race.  Being an everyday man or a child, depending on your perspective, this directly illustrates how I see myself in the world, and how I live my life.<p>
