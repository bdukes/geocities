<b>We want to get to know you as a person. Make up a question that is personally relevant to you, state it clearly and answer it. Feel free to use your imagination, recognizing that those who read it will not mind being entertained.<p></b>

What would you consider to be a perfect world?<p>
My perfect world does not hinge on everyone having everything they need and want, or on elimination of disease, but on people. As I see it, perfection is reached as the people of the world become perfect. Despite disease, hunger, and want, if all people could not even reach perfection, but strive towards bettering themselves, so many of the problems which our world experiences would cease. As people learned how to tolerate each others' differences, and respect each other, even while possibly disagreeing, minor disputes would be handled without the trauma that often occurs. In the same vein, politically, if malice were eliminated and, through that, fear, the long sought goal of world peace could be readily achieved. Domestically, children would grow up happier and healthier as they were supported and loved by their parents, instead of ignored or abused. People would no longer live in need, as others would find no other way to live but to give their possessions and their selves as much as they could to those in need. The needs of people would be of more concern to those in business than making money. Those luxuries that were produced would not be hoarded among the rich, but, there being no rich, would be given to all who saw a need for them. There would be no more cause for an economic system, since people more concerned with the welfare of others than of themselves wouldn't be able to steal or be stolen from, and would only take as much as they needed. Even those things not directly taken care of by people changing, those being natural disasters and disease, would be less hazardous, since disaster relief and medical aid would be better supplied by the enormous growth of humanitarians. Those people who did end up still living in want would not suffer as much, being comforted by the righteous lives they found themselves now living, and by the lives of those around them. Comfort would also be found in the knowledge that death had not the horrible meaning it has gained in our age and culture.<br>
Concludingly, I'm not so naï¿½ve as to think that this world in my head would be without troubles or without pain. Even perfect people wouldn't always get along and always be able to understand one another perfectly. But, what I am saying, is that, those things which I have detailed above being goals I have set for myself, that I have come to see that living in that manner, or trying to, will produce favourable results. If everyone could try to live like that, so many of the day-to-day worries many of us experience, and so many day-to-day worries that other people experience that most Americans can't even fathom, would become much easier to handle, if not become non-existent. That is the perfect world, to me, people caring enough for one another to take each others' burdens upon themselves.<p>
