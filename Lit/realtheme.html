The instructor said,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Go home and write <BR>
    a page tonight. <BR>
    And let that page come out of you--- <BR>
    Then, it will be true.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I wonder if it's that simple? <BR>
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem. <BR>
I went to school there, then Durham, then here <BR>
to this college on the hill above Harlem. <BR>
I am the only colored student in my class. <BR>
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem <BR>
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas, <BR>
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y, <BR>
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator <BR>
up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
<P>
It's not easy to know what is true for you or me <BR>
at twenty-two, my age.  But I guess I'm what <BR>
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you: <BR>
hear you, hear me---we two---you, me, talk on this page. <BR>
(I hear New York too.)  Me---who? <BR>
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love. <BR>
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. <BR>
I like a pipe for a Christmas present, <BR>
or records---Bessie, bop, or Bach. <BR>
I guess being colored doesn't make me NOT like <BR>
the same things other folks like who are other races. <BR>
So will my page be colored that I write? <BR>
Being me, it will not be white. <BR>
But it will be <BR>
a part of you, instructor. <BR>
You are white--- <BR>
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you. <BR>
That's American. <BR>
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me. <BR>
Nor do I often want to be a part of you. <BR>
But we are, that's true! <BR>
As I learn from you,<BR>
I guess you learn from me--- <BR>
although you're older---and white--- <BR>
and somewhat more free.
<P>
This is my page for English B.<p><BR>
