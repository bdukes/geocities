The instructor said,<BR>
<BR>
	Go home and write<BR>
	a page tonight.<BR>
	And let that page come out of you�<BR>
	Then, it will be true.<BR>
<BR>
If it comes out of me, it�ll be true?<BR>
I guess I can try, and live up to those standards,<BR>
While failing all the time.<BR>
That�s what my life is now,<BR>
striving to be right, while knowing I�m wrong.<BR>
I�m just a 16 year old kid from Kansas,<BR>
been as far east as Tennessee, west to Utah,<BR>
been north to Minnesota, south to Texas.<BR>
I live in a bubble, or so people�ve said.<BR>
Yet, in spite of all this, I too claim a hold on Truth, of the highest order.<BR>
<BR>
I�m sitting here writing this,<BR>
trying my hardest to pour out my heart,<BR>
while not looking too deep into myself,<BR>
afraid of what I might find, what I�ve found before.<BR>
Well, my heart is this: living life not for myself,<BR>
but to give much-deserved glory to my King.<BR>
And no earthly king could deserve such devotion and praise,<BR>
I could only settle for perfection and He is God.<BR>
<BR>
�Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for Me.�<BR>
And I want so desperately to serve Him.<BR>
I want so desperately to come before Him,<BR>
to hear Him say �Well done, My good and faithful servant.�<BR>
Both of us know that I�ll always fail, but He�s taken care of that.<BR>
And so I serve Him, by serving everyone else.<BR>
I go to Tennessee and help repair a trailer.<BR>
I go to an old woman�s house and rake her yard.<BR>
I go on the Internet and try to help others know Him more completely.<BR>
<BR>
So, teacher, that�s me, or at least I am that.<BR>
I�ll try my hardest to respect the authority you have been given,<BR>
so please don�t think I�m rebellious, I�m just independent.<BR>
And I�d hope you could learn to respect that in me, as I will respect you.<BR>
You teach and I�ll try to learn, that�s really all I can promise.<BR>
That�s really all I can say.<BR>
I hope I can become the student you�d like me to be,<BR>
As long as I can still, in the process, be me.<BR>
<BR>
This is my page for English III.<BR><BR>
