<b>What is the most significant contribution that you feel you have made to your community's well-being or the well-being of an individual or individuals in your community?  Why were you motivated to do this?  What effect do you think it has had on that person or the community?</b><p>

	The most significant contribution I have made to the well-being of individuals within my community, so far as I can determine, has to be what I do in being one of the main leaders of my church�s youth ministry.  Our church�s youth minister was called to another church last August, and, since then, we�ve been without a strong leader.  There was elected an interim youth minister from the youth workers who volunteer with us, but she is organizational more than being anything of a teacher and leader, as well as being without any formal training in how to best communicate with kids effectively.  As a result, the older youth have had to �step up� and take on leadership positions.  In the case of the male side of the youth ministry, that�s proved to be a task left mostly undone.  Before our youth minister left, the group of what would now be high school juniors and seniors was the largest group in the ministry.  As it currently stands, there are, including myself, three senior and zero junior guys who show up.  And the other two aren�t very regular in coming.  So, I have to be a leader to the young guys.  Outside of myself, many of them lack a good Christian peer role model that they can relate to.  I have to be that for them as much as I can.  I have to provide an example for them �in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity�(1Timothy 4:12 NIV).  When I am interacting with the young guys, their benefit has to be the first priority on my mind.  I always make sure to keep everything that I do something that I would like for them to mimic if they were in the same situation.  Ultimately, I try to keep these kids, as best as God has enabled me, on the narrow path, keeping always in tune with God, always seeking after His glory, primarily, before all else.  And, from looking at the lives that most of these kids are leading, I�d say that God�s been using me very effectively.  Pure, true worship springs forth from their lips on Sunday mornings.  Growth in their lives and in their minds is becoming more and more evident.  They live lives truly devoted to seeking our glorious God.  And I�m proud to be able to say that I have been used to a small degree in helping to achieve that.<p>
