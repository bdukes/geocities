Two stars is all I see<BR>
I look around... could <i>that</i> be?<BR>
Another? Maybe?<BR>
I can't be sure<BR>
A paradox<BR>
Too much light to see their light.<BR>
I'm lost<BR>
In a sea of convenience<BR>
That I can't see<BR>
What they make me miss<BR>
Until I climb upon the roof
And look out<BR>
And find nothing.<BR>
So hard to see God's creation<BR>
It's hidden<BR>
Not because it hides<BR>
But we hide it from ourselves<BR>
And even here, on the roof<BR>
You'd think I could find some peace<BR>
Music pours out from my brother's open window<BR>
A car passes, interrupting my thoughts<BR>
I'd be better off stuffed inside my room<BR>
With the fan on the computer<BR>
And my jumping chinchilla<BR>
Peace cannot be found in a place<BR>
In a thing<BR>
In a person<BR>
I must rely on You for all this<BR>
And, if peace is only found when i release the world<BR>
What else is there I'm missing out on?<BR>
If I just let go, what will i find?<BR><BR>
