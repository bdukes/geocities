<b>Describe a situation where you were called upon to demonstrate your leadership ability or where you were able to make a significant contribution to the solution of a problem or issue that arose in your school, community, or family life, or where you were able to act as a moral exemplar.<p></b>

	As the lead vocalist in my church�s youth worship band, and as one of the few high-school-age guys who actively participate in the youth ministry, I am called upon quite often to be a leader to the younger kids in the youth ministry.  Being in front of the kids most every week, I am a very visible model for them.  As such, I need to act as an example to them in a variety of ways.  Primarily being a worship leader, I always have to make sure that I am worshipping wholeheartedly, concentrating on God, because if I�m not concentrating, it�s going to be much harder for them to be focused.  As much as I try always to be pleasing to God, I have to make sure to keep myself in check that much more when I�m around the younger kids, keeping away from even the appearance of doing evil.<BR>
	One of my duties as a worship leader is planning the worship service.  As part of the planning committee, I help to come up with ways to get the students to interact with what we�re doing, and, ultimately, to interact with God.  I like to be a leader for the youth, to be able to be an example for them in how to act, how to live, how to worship God.  I know that the kids look up to me quite a bit, and, so, I always make sure that I provide the best possible example for them, to spur them on towards the goal of intimate communion with God.<BR>
	As I�m up in front of the kids, singing or praying, or, occasionally, talking, I make it a priority to keep my focus on God, and serving Him through what I�m doing, listening to Him so I can know what it is He wants me to be doing with them, rather than trying to use my own abilities as a guide.  We have a sign that the leaders on stage can see hanging up in the room that says �An Audience of One.�  That�s our main goal, to keep focused on God, to make Him the center of all we do, and, through that, to benefit the others who have hopefully come to do the same.<p>
