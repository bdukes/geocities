<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/3x1.jpg"><br>Mr. Fred Jones.  I hate to badmouth the guy, but...man.  He's worthless as a comp sci teacher.  Cool guy, though, in general.  Can ride a unicycle, or so I'm told.</center></td>
<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/4x1.jpg"><br>Spencer Chu.  Best programmer in my C++ class.  Asian, and proud of it.  A generally cool kid.  Took calculus in 9th grade.</center></td>

<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/5x1.jpg"><br>Pocket Tanks.  The C++ class diversion of choice.  Especially once you pirate the nuke and assault packs, get those extra weapons.  Heh.</center></td>
<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/6x1.jpg"><br>Uh....Tina.  She's in my C++ class.  Not...quite sure why i took a picture of 'er.  I think i was planning to take pictures of everyone at that point, and then decided against it when i got to band the next hour.  Heh.</center></td>

<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/7x1.jpg"><br>Michael Wu.  C++ class. Same explanation as Tina.</center></td>
<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/8x1.jpg"><br>When Pocket Tanks get boring, we move on to an emulated version of Contra for the NES.  High quality.  All i have to say.    Especially considering the inexplicable lag of the emulators.  We still play 'em, even though...they shouldn't be considered playable.  heh</center></td>

<td><center><img src="/angelfire/intehlife/9x1.jpg"><br>Band class.  Uh...yeah.  Not a whole lot going on there.  It's band, y'know?</center></td>
